    <span class="lb">This is a Auto Hotkey script that I made in order to help me in Minecraft so that I can measure the angles of eyes of ender in order to find strongholds easier.
    </span>

    <span class="lb">The way Minecraft strongholds are found is by using eyes of ender, which when thrown, direct you on the most optimal path towards the stronghold. Due to the fact that they use the most optimal path, players have figured out that if you measure the angle of one of the pixels on the eye when it is thrown you are able to find the stronghold within only 1 eye of ender when usually it takes a lot more.

    <span class="lb">This measurement needs to be pixel perfect, so to help me I created an Auto Hotkey script to magnify my game by extreme amounts and lower my DPI in order to make this measuring easier.
