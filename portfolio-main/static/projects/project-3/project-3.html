    <span class="lb">This is a program that uses plotly to graph the salary compared to the performance score of different employees at a company.
    </span>

    <span class="lb">This program also allows for the user to hover over each plot point and see additional information such as the name of the employee, their position, their years working at the company, age, and gender. 
    </span>

    <span class="lb">Each plot point is coloured specifically based on position, and if I were to further this project I might add a feature that shows outliers (people who are getting paid too much or too little for their work).
